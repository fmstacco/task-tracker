# Objective 

The aim of this project is to deliver a command line interface task manager so the user can track their to do list. 

# User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience

* Anyone who wants to track and manage all the tasks that need to be done.

## User Stories

* As a new user I want to easily understand how to use the system and how it can help me.
* As a new user or returning visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the system through the command line.
* As a new user I want to be able to create a unique username, add tasks to the system, view saved tasks as well as delete tasks.
* As a visitor returning, I want to be able to access the system through a unique username, add new tasks, retrieve previously saved tasks, as well as delete tasks.
* As a new user or returning visitor, I want to be able to close the system easily when I finish using it.

## Owner Stories

* As the owner, I want to offer a system that is easy to use for both the new user and a visitor returning, and helps the user better organize what needs to be done in their daily lives.
* As the owner, I want to ensure that the data entered is correct, valid and stored safely.

# Technologies Used

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html) - the main language of the application.
* [Gitbash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) - to push changes to the GitHub repository.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - to host the repositories.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - as the IDE for the application.
* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) - to create a project for the API.
* [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) - to store a database for the users tasks.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to deploy the project.
* [Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com/) - to create the flow chart.
* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) - for testing and validating the code.
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - to validate the HTML.

### Python Libraries

* [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) to print text to the terminal in different colours and styles.
* [gspread](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) - to link the database spreadsheet with Google Sheets.
* [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to import credentials and access to Google service accounts.
* [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - to display the tasks saved in a table format.

# Credits 

* [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) to reinforce learning on Python.

* [Code Institute Python Project template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template-v1) - the framework for this project.

* [Youtube Gustavo Guanabara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLHz_AreHm4dlKP6QQCekuIPky1CiwmdI6) - to reinforce learning on Python.

* [Personalized task manager in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/personalized-task-manager-in-python/) - inspired me to structure my project.

* [Create a Task Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynd67UwG_cI&t=351s) - inspired me to structure my project.




## Code

* [GitHub Mortgage Calculator](https://github.com/frankiesanjana/mortgage-calculator/) - This code was developed having as a main inspiration this repository. I borrowed some of the code from this repository to help create the task manager, to save the user, send the tasks to the spreadsheet, retrieve it, etc. I have also customized the code to achieve the project goals.  

* [Simple Personality Quiz](https://github.com/edubz99/Simple-Personality-Quiz) - this repository was also among my initial inspirations for the quiz. 

* [Youtube Code Feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnH56whHQqw) - this tutorial was my first inspiration for the quiz. I even deployed the walkthrough I have done following this tutorial. However, I ended up choosing the WebShala tutorial, as this one uses the HTML as a database for the questions, not a separated file on JavaScript. 

* [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) - the code for the alert for the unsuccessful form submission.

* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com) - the code to make the form effective for submitting potential clients' data to my email.
